# SendDataFrom-R-Python-to-SQL-PSQL-Mongo



There are common situations where you would like to interface with different platforms and send data directly. For this short project I will use `R` and `Python` where we will create data for sending to to different databases with function calls.


`R to MySQl,PSQL`:  `RPostgreSQL` | `generator` | `randomNames` | `RMysql`


`Python to Mysql, MongoDB,PostgreSQL`: `psycopg2` | `pyMongo` | 'mysql-connect'
