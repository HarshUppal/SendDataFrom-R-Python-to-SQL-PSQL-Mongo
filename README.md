# SendDataFrom-R-Python-to-SQL-PSQL-Mongo



There are common situations where you would like to interface with different platforms and send data directly. For this short project I will use `R` and `Python` where we will create data for sending to to different databases with function calls.


`R to MySQl,PSQL`:  `RPostgreSQL` | `generator` | `randomNames` | `RMysql`

`----------------------------------------`

`Python to Mysql, MongoDB,PostgreSQL`: `psycopg2` | `pyMongo` | `mysql-connect`

`Dict_Hstore_Psql.ipynb`: Using HStore in postgresql featuring (psycog2), has the JSON like functionality we need to parse data. 

`HOW TO SEND DATA from Python to PSQL.ipynb`: this will cover using cofig files, using psycopg2 to connect to psogresql, query and send .csv and dataframe, using a memory profiler

`HOWTO Generate Fake Data with R and sending to MYSQL.ipynb`: Using Python faker, to create a fake dataset
